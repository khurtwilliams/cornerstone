## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Cornerstone theme team (that's one person, me) takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by email to:

**security@islandinthenet.com**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)

- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. Confirm receipt of your vulnerability report
2. Investigate and validate the issue
3. Determine the severity and impact
4. Work on a fix and release timeline
5. Keep you informed of our progress
6. Credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Disclosure Policy
